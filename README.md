<h2>Mystery_Maze</h2>
<h3>Milestones met until now:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Milestone 1:
  <p>Requirements</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement a basic maze generation algorithm, such as depth-first search or recursive backtracking.</li>
    <li>Ensure the paths lead to dead ends, exit doors, or hidden treasures.</li>
    <li>Introduce spike obstacles that the player must avoid.</li>
    <li>Randomly generate the maze each time for enhanced replayability.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Implementations for the same</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For generating the maze, I used the a DFS based Algorithm.
      <li>The paths as of now lead to a Door(at roughly the top of the maze),a Treasure Chest (roughly the center or middle portion) and a lot of dead ends.
      <li>There are spike obstacles that are generated randomly(number of them : 1 to 4 randomly , can make it level dependent later).
      <li>The maze generated as of now is uniques for every gameplay.
    </ul>

  [Milestone1] : (https://github.com/anonymous-1506/Mystery_Maze/assets/148906347/5863330a-3ee4-40f6-93fc-b0661598eb40)

<li>
  Milestone 2:
  <p>Requirements</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow the player character to move left, right, up, and down using touch controls, WASD keys, or arrow keys.
    <li>Implement player movement and collision detection with maze walls.
    <li>Enable the spacebar or a double-tap key to drop a bomb.
  </ul>
  <p>Implementations</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Player movements are controlled by UP/DOWN... Arrow keys.
    <li>Collision system with Maze walls, Door(prior to key collection) and spiked walls is implemented.
    <li>Spacebar now deploys a bomb(3m in number at the start of the game).
  </ul>
